# sachverhalt-cli

#### The client-side reference implementation of the sachverhalt protocol

`sachverhalt-cli` is a command-line interface to sachverhalt written, extended
and configured in haskell.

There is no official `sachverhalt` spec to link to yet, but in essence, it is a
simple, extendable, JSON-based protocol for managing issues.

You can have a look at [some examples][examples] and [the server-side reference
implementation][sachverhalt-server].
